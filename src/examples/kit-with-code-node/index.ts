Though these breeds are proven to be resilient there can still be complications as all dogs are different. If you are getting a dog from a breeder make sure it is a reputable one and if you are adopting contact your veterinarian to get your dog checked out. No dogs will be 100% healthy their entire life but this list of dogs can hold their own.`
